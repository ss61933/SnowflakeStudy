-- as we have seen that all context functions are functions in snowflake, and it needs to be part of the select statement
-- so lets see how to list all functions in the snowflake
show functions like 'CURRENT%IP%';

select current_ip_address();
//this qury execute without any computation cost 

-- use it to set variable value
set my_ip_address = current_ip_address();
select $my_ip_address;

-- Step-3 
-- let's run a query on login history
use role accountadmin;
select * from "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."LOGIN_HISTORY" limit 10;
//login history shows cleint ip for all login events 


//when logged in from webui , you will see 2 sessions. 1 for webui instance and other for worksheet
//if u login from some other tool then only 1 session will appear

--to get only  important columns , 
select event_id, event_type, user_name, 
    first_authentication_factor, 
    second_authentication_factor, 
    is_success from "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."LOGIN_HISTORY" limit 10;

-- Step 4 we can get client details in below view as well 
use role accountadmin;
select * from "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."SESSIONS";

-- Step 5
--- which query is fired by whom using what kind of client and what kind of authenticaion is used and from which ip
use role accountadmin;
select * from "SNOWFLAKE"."ACCOUNT_USAGE"."QUERY_HISTORY" limit 10;


-- lets build a report
use role accountadmin;
use database SNOWFLAKE;
use schema ACCOUNT_USAGE;
use warehouse compute_wh;
select s.user_name, s.session_id, qh.query_id,qh.query_text, lh.reported_client_type, lh.client_ip from 
    QUERY_HISTORY qh join sessions s on s.session_id = qh.session_id
                     join LOGIN_HISTORY lh on s.login_event_id = lh.event_id;
                     
                     
    // Make a note that if you have any task scheudled , which fetched and inserts current ip address 
    // then null value will be returned
